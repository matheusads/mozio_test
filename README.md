Hello guys!


To run this project locally you need Docker and Docker Compose.


You also can access in AWS at: ec2-54-207-158-29.sa-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com in the following routes:

/redoc (ReDoc)
/docs (Swagger)

/providers
/service_areas

Of course this is not a production ready code, so there are improvements to be made, specially in configuration files, 
docker files.

I used Yapf and Isort to format the files.

There's some unit tests in api/tests but is necessary create more for exceptions cases for example.

Was a great experience code this a

That's all folks!
